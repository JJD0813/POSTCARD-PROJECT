# ✉️ Digital Postcard with HTML & CSS  

This project is a beginner-friendly exercise designed to practice **HTML5** and **CSS3** by creating a personalized digital postcard.  

It replicates a postcard layout with a header, message section, input fields, and a button, styled to look like a real postcard. This project helped me practice layout, typography, and styling fundamentals while also learning how to link Google Fonts and organize code cleanly.
